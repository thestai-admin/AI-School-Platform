Subject: Save your teachers 10 hours/week - AI tool for [School Name]

Dear [Principal Name] ji,

I'm [Your Name], founder of AI Pathshala.

I've built an AI tool specifically for Indian schools that helps teachers:
- Create NCERT-aligned lesson plans in 30 seconds
- Auto-grade homework with detailed feedback
- Provide 24/7 AI tutoring for students (in Hindi too)

Teachers using it save 10-15 hours every week.

[X] schools in [City/State] are already using it, including [Reference School if any].

Would you be open to a 10-minute call or demo this week?

I'm available:
- [Day 1] at [Time]
- [Day 2] at [Time]

Or suggest a time that works for you.

Best regards,
