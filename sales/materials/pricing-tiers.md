```
1 teacher saves 10 hours/week
= 40 hours/month
At Rs 200/hour value = Rs 8,000/month per teacher

5 teachers = Rs 40,000/month value
Cost of Growth plan = Rs 4,000/month

ROI = 10x
```

## Objection Handling: Price

**"Too expensive"**
> "Sir, calculate with me: 1 teacher grades 5 hours/week = Rs 4,000/month value at Rs 200/hour. Our Growth plan for 10 teachers costs Rs 4,000 total - same cost, saves 50 hours! It actually saves money."

**"We can't afford software"**
> "Starting at Rs 2,000/month - less than what you spend on chalk, paper, and printing. And teachers get 10+ hours back weekly."

**"Per-student is confusing"**
> "Simple flat fee: Rs 4,000/month for 10 teachers. That's it. No per-student calculation needed."
