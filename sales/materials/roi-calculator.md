# AI Pathshala ROI Calculator

## Quick ROI Arguments (Use in Sales Calls)

### The 5-Hour Argument

```
"Sir, ek teacher homework grading mein kitna time lagata hai?"
[They say: 4-6 hours/week typically]

"Aur lesson planning?"
[They say: 3-5 hours/week typically]

"Toh total 8-10 hours/week repetitive work mein.

AI Pathshala se yeh 1-2 hours ho jata hai.
Per teacher 6-8 hours/week bachta hai.

5 teachers = 30-40 hours/week saved.
Monthly = 120-160 hours.

At even Rs 100/hour value = Rs 12,000-16,000/month value.
AI Pathshala cost = Rs 4,000/month.

ROI = 3-4x. First month mein."
```

---

### The Printing Cost Argument

```
"Monthly printing aur paper pe kitna kharcha hai?"
[Usually Rs 2,000-5,000 for small schools]

"AI Pathshala se worksheets digital.
Students phone/laptop pe karte hain.
Ya ek copy print karo, sab use karein.

Printing cost kam ho jayega.
Rs 2,000/month saved from printing alone.

AI Pathshala Starter = Rs 2,000/month.
So basically FREE after printing savings!"
```

---

### The Teacher Retention Argument

```
"Achhe teachers resign karte hain kya kabhi?"
[Usually yes, workload is common reason]

"Ek teacher ko replace karne ka cost:
- Hiring time: 10-20 hours
- Training time: 20-40 hours
- Probation period: lower quality teaching
- Total cost: easily Rs 20,000-50,000

AI Pathshala reduces workload.
Happy teachers stay longer.
Even 1 teacher retention = 10-25x ROI on annual subscription."
```

## Detailed ROI Calculation

### Input Variables (Fill During Sales Call)

| Variable | Their Answer | Default |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| Number of teachers | ___ | 10 |
| Avg hours grading/week per teacher | ___ | 5 |
| Avg hours lesson planning/week per teacher | ___ | 4 |
| Teacher hourly value (salary/hours) | Rs ___ | Rs 150 |
| Monthly printing/paper cost | Rs ___ | Rs 3,000 |
| Number of students | ___ | 300 |
| Current AI Pathshala plan cost | Rs ___ | Rs 4,000 |

### ROI Calculation

**Time Savings Calculation:**
```
Hours saved per teacher per week = (Grading hours × 0.8) + (Planning hours × 0.9)
Example: (5 × 0.8) + (4 × 0.9) = 4 + 3.6 = 7.6 hours/week

Total hours saved = Hours saved × Number of teachers
Example: 7.6 × 10 = 76 hours/week

Monthly hours saved = 76 × 4 = 304 hours/month

Value of time saved = 304 × Rs 150 = Rs 45,600/month
```

**Printing Savings:**
```
Estimated reduction = 30-50% of printing costs
Example: Rs 3,000 × 0.4 = Rs 1,200/month
```

**Total Monthly Value:**
```
Time savings + Printing savings = Rs 45,600 + Rs 1,200 = Rs 46,800/month
```

**ROI:**
```
ROI = (Value - Cost) / Cost × 100
    = (Rs 46,800 - Rs 4,000) / Rs 4,000 × 100
    = 1,070% ROI

Or simply: 11.7x return on investment
```

**Payback Period:**
```
Payback = Cost / Monthly Value
        = Rs 4,000 / Rs 46,800
        = 0.085 months
        = ~2.5 days

"Aapka investment 3 din mein recover ho jata hai!"
```

## Handling "No Budget" with ROI

```
"Main samajhta hoon budget concern.

But let's calculate:
- 5 teachers, 5 hours/week grading
- = 100 hours/month
- At Rs 100/hour (conservative) = Rs 10,000/month value

AI Pathshala Growth plan = Rs 4,000/month

Net savings = Rs 6,000/month
That's Rs 72,000/year SAVED.

Yeh cost nahi hai, savings hai.
Budget se nahi, savings se pay karo."
