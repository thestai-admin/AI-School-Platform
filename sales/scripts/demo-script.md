## Next Steps Script

Koi upfront payment nahi. Trial bilkul free.

Admin email address bata dijiye, main setup kar deta hoon."

### If Need to Think

```

3. Next week follow-up karunga

Koi questions ho toh WhatsApp kar dijiyega."
```

### If Price Objection

```
"Main samajh sakta hoon.

Ek calculation karte hain:
- 1 teacher 5 hours/week grading bachata hai
- 5 teachers = 25 hours/week = 100 hours/month
- At Rs 100/hour value = Rs 10,000/month

Cost: Rs 4,000/month

Actually paisa bach raha hai.

Shall we start with Starter plan at Rs 2,000/month? Only 5 teachers?"
```
